            <blockquote>"If you are not sure whether something is allowed, then it is probably NOT allowed."</blockquote>
            <p>All rules are based on common sense, the spirit of the sport, and the safety of all participants.</p>

            <p>The goal of Robot Vehicles is to cover a distance of 10 meters in the shortest possible time.</p>
            <p><strong>As the sport promotes constructions as close to the real world, all Robot Vehicles should replicate realistic rally vehicles as closely as possible. Creators should take this into account during their experimentation.</strong></p>

                <li>During the initial inspection, the team will be asked questions about the critical parts of the robot's program.
                    <br>‚û§ The team must have their laptop with the robot's program open.
                    <br>‚û§ If it becomes clear from the answers that the team does not understand the program, they will receive a penalty equal to +20% of the time they achieve in the event.</li>
                <li>The technical inspection includes a robot examination based on the specifications described above.
                    <br>‚û§ If the robot does not meet the requirements, it will not be allowed to compete and will be automatically disqualified from the event.</li>
                <li>After the completion of the initial inspection, the Robot Athlete is assigned its unique ID code.</li>
                <li>If a team is not present at the time of the initial technical inspection, it will result in automatic disqualification from the competition.</li>
                <li>A secondary technical inspection is also conducted before each attempt, performed by the assistant referee.</li>
                <li>If, during the competition procedure, the referee determines that a Robot Athlete is violating or failing to meet the prescribed specifications, the referee has the right to disqualify it immediately.</li>

                <li>The length of the track is 10 meters and the width is 90 centimeters.</li>
                <li>There is a 5 cm thick black line in the center of the track.</li>
                <li>There is a 6 cm high protective wall along the right and left.</li>
                <li>At the beginning of the track there is a horizontal black line 2 to 5 cm thick, which marks the start. Be careful in your programming as your robot should not stop when it passes over the black start line.</li>
                <li>At the end of the 10 meter distance there is a horizontal black line 2-5 cm thick, which marks the end of the route.</li>
                <li>After the end of 10 meters, there is an additional distance of 5 meters, which is defined as the braking zone. The end of the braking zone is marked by a black line 2-5 cm thick, behind which there is a protective barrier made of soft material.</li>
                <li>The Race is held simultaneously for 2 or more Vehicles (depending on the number of teams), each of them on one racing track.</li>
                <li>The black line in the center of the track may be used for a line sequence but not required by the Sport.</li>
                <li>At the start there is a timing gate, as well as a mechanism that raises and lowers a black flag. Raising the flag after the countdown triggers the robots to start.</li>
                <li>For testing of the Robot Vehicles before the start of the Competition, there will be trial rounds, where the Technicians will have access for a specific time period and according to a schedule that will be announced on the day of the competition.</li>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">üèÅ START - RACE PROCEDURE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each Vehicle races alone around the track against time.</li>
                <li>At the starting point on the track there is a time gate. In front of the gate a black flag is placed. Vehicles must locate the flag.</li>
                <li>The referee will start the countdown 3,2,1, we go and the black flag is raised.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle must detect that the flag has been raised and start.</li>
                <li>Time starts counting as soon as the flag is raised.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle should start within the next 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>If a Vehicle does not start within this time, then the referee will only give one restart. This will only be done on the first attempt.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle should cover the distance of 10 meters in the shortest possible time.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle (or any part of it) is not allowed to go outside the boundaries of the track. If this is done, then he is considered to have failed the attempt.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle must completely cross the finish line.</li>
                <li>The Vehicle should be able to stop and stay in the braking zone.</li>
                <li><strong>If the Vehicle passes through the braking zone and hits the protective barrier, it will be penalized by multiplying the time achieved by a factor of 1.3.</strong></li>
                <li>The same rule applies if any part of the Vehicle touches the wall during its course.</li>
                <li>If the Vehicle is canceled for any reason in the attempt then a time of 180 sec (180) is recorded.</li>
