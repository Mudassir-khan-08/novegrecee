            <h2>üéØ MATCH PREPARATION - START - PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start of the match, the ball is placed by the referee approximately in the middle of the pool. All Water Polo Robots must touch part of the side wall of the goal. One Robot Athlete is placed to the right, and the other is placed to the left of the goal.</li>
                <li>The match starts with the referee's whistle. All Water Polo Robots should start moving after the referee's whistle.</li>
                <li>If an alliance scores a goal, then, without stopping time, the ball is placed in the center of the pool by the referee and is free for both alliances to claim again. The match is not interrupted but continues until the end of the 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>If there is a Water Polo Robot on the target point at that time, then the ball is placed as close as possible to the target, but not directly in front of the robot located there. The referee will place it as close as to the center pool, so that no advantage is given to any Water Polo Robot.</li>
                <li>If some of the Water Polo Robots get stuck together, then the referee can separate them by moving them as little as possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Restrictions -->
        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è RESTRICTIONS / FOULS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The referee will blow the whistle for "illegal marking" if a Water Polo Robot attempting to get the ball behind an opposing Water Polo Robot is found to be pushing and dragging him onto the pool. After the whistle, the ball is placed in the center of the pool and play continues, without stopping time. If a goal is scored due to pushing, it is disallowed.</li>
                <li>The referee will whistle a "red card" if any Water Polo Robot is found to be deliberately trying to injure an opponent. In this case the Water Polo Robot is kicked out of the match and the alliance continues with 1 Water Polo Robot. The referee places the ball back in the center of the pool and the match continues with the Water Polo Robots in the position they were in when the referee blew the "red card" whistle.</li>
                <li>The Technicians are not allowed to touch their Water Polo Robots throughout the match without the permission of the referee. In such a case the referee blew the "red card" whistle.</li>
                <li>If the ball goes out, outside the boundaries of the pool or behind the goal posts, the referee places the ball back on the cue ball located in the center of the pool. If there is a Water Polo Robot on the target at that time, then the ball is placed as close as possible to the target, but not directly in front of the robot located there. The referee will place it as close as to the center, so that no advantage is given to any Water Polo Robot.</li>
                <li>It is forbidden for any Water Polo Robot of the defending alliance to stand still in front of their goal intentionally or move parallel to the goal line for more than 3 seconds. If it is determined by the referee that the ball was thus prevented from heading towards the goal, the Water Polo Robot is rejected from that match and the alliance continues with 1 Water Polo Robot.</li>
                <li>The decisions of the referees are final. Objection to these decisions can only be lodged with the Headjudges. Disputing the final decisions of the Headjudges may result in a team or alliance being disqualified.</li>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>ü§ï WATER POLO ROBOT INJURY</h2>
            <p><strong>A Water Polo Robot is deemed injured by the referee when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>some part of it has been disassembled,</li>
                <li>remains stationary (lost connection to laptop, controller or tablet),</li>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Injury Procedures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>An injured Water Polo Robot remains out of the pool until repairs are completed by the team. After permission is given by the referee, he returns to the match. The returning Water Polo Robot is placed in the starting position of the match.</li>
                <li>If a Water Polo Robot falls over for any reason, with the help of the referee it gets back up and continues the game.</li>
                <li>If all Water Polo Robots in an alliance are injured and out of the game, time stops and restarts when even one Water Polo Robot returns to the field.</li>
                <li>If a Water Polo Robot is injured during the match due to the fault of the referee, then the timer stops and the team is given time to repair. Time starts ticking again after the return of the Water Polo Robot. The players and the ball are placed in the starting position of a match.</li>

                <li>If the referee detects that the ball is trapped in any way, he places the ball back in the center of the field and the Water Polo Robot away from it. If the blocking is repeated then it is considered intentional and the Water Polo Robot is disqualified from that match.
