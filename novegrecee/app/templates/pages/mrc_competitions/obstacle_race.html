All motor/sensor connections are made directly to the official hub, with official cables/parts of the kit; external microcontrollers, motor drivers/ESCs, non-official adapters/converters, or additional power sources/boosters are not permitted. Interoperability of official components of the same manufacturer is permitted when plug-compatible or via an official adapter (e.g., LEGO SPIKE motor on a LEGO Robot Inventor hub). 3D-printed parts of any kind are not permitted.

                    <br>‚û§ The team must have their laptop with the robot's program open.
                    <br>‚û§ If it becomes clear from the answers that the team does not understand the program, they will receive a penalty equal to -20% of the time they achieve in the event.</li>
                <li>The technical inspection includes a robot examination based on the specifications described above.
                    <br>‚û§ If the robot does not meet the requirements, it will not be allowed to compete and will be automatically disqualified from the event.</li>

                <li>If a team is not present at the time of the initial technical inspection, it will result in automatic disqualification from the competition.</li>
                <li>A secondary technical inspection is also conducted before each attempt, performed by the assistant referee.</li>
                <li>If, during the competition procedure, the referee determines that a Robot Athlete is violating or failing to meet the prescribed specifications, the referee has the right to disqualify it immediately.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The Technician who will run the round, places the Robot Athlete at the starting point, before the time control sensor.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must be in standby mode, ready to start as soon as the start button is pressed or the button on the remote control is activated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">üèÅ START ‚Äì RACE PROCEDURE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Technician of the Robot Athlete starts the Robot Athlete after the referee's whistle, by pressing the Start button. The timer begins when the Robot Athlete passes in front of the time control sensor.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must start within the next 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>If a Robot Athlete does not start within that time, the referee will allow only one restart.
                    <br>‚û§ This will apply only to the first attempt.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must begin moving as quickly as possible, following the black line.</li>
                <li>The goal of the Robot Athlete is to finish the course in the shortest possible time.</li>
                <li>If a Robot Athlete exceeds 4 minutes, the referee ends the round with a whistle and the time is recorded as 180 seconds (0 points).</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete (or any part of it) is not allowed to exit the boundaries of the arena.
                    <br>‚û§ If this happens, the attempt is considered failed.</li>
                <li>The robot is allowed to leave the track for a maximum of 3 seconds during the run (e.g., when making a turn or zigzagging while following the line). However, the robot must continue to follow the line in the correct direction.
                    <br>‚û§ If the robot completely exits the track or loses its direction, the attempt is invalid.</li>
                <li>If the track is larger than the dimensions described in the previous section, the expected time will be increased.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must continuously cover the line with its body throughout the course (with minor exceptions at turns) and must follow it using sensors placed in a central position on the robot, reading above or directly next to the line.
                    <br>‚û§ If it is clear that the navigation does not rely on line detection in this way, the attempt is invalid, and the time is recorded as zero (0).</li>
                <li>If the Robot Athlete fails to start, the time is recorded as 180 seconds (0).</li>

                <li>If a Technician is not present when it is their turn, they lose their attempt, and the next Technician in line will proceed.
                    <br>‚û§ The Technician who missed their turn must wait until all other attempts are completed for their turn to come again.</li>
                <li>Before each attempt, the Robot Athlete must pass a secondary technical inspection conducted by the assistant referee.</li>
                <li>The referee records the time of the Robot Athletes for each attempt.</li>
                <li>It is the responsibility of the Robot Athlete's team to ensure that they perform each attempt within the allocated time window.</li>
