            <h3>‚è±Ô∏è PREPARATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. A single robot Athlete competes in a match.</li>
                <li>2. All other Robot Athletes must wait in a line.</li>
                <li>3. The Robot Athlete will be placed behind the starting line.</li>
                <li>4. At the beginning of each attempt, the Robot Athlete's Technician will inform the referee how many CDs they want their Athlete to attempt to lift and the referee will attach the desired weight to the lift bar.</li>
                <li>5. The number of CD's must be increased after each successful attempt of a robot Athlete. The Robot Athlete technician may specify to the referee how many additional CD's he wishes to be added to the bar prior to each attempt.</li>
                <li>6. <strong>The addition of CD's to the bar are done simultaneously on both sides of it, for example if the technician chooses to add 3 extra CD's then the referee will add 3 CD's to each side of the bar, so 6 CD's extra weight.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">üèÅ START - PROCESS OF THE RACE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The technician places the Robot Athlete on the starting line so that the front of his foot is directly behind the white line and his arms are vertical, parallel to his body.</li>
                <li>The referee will signal the start of the match.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete's technician must press the start button in order for the Athlete Robot to operate.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete should start moving after 5 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>The Robot Athlete should move to the receiving line of the bar and pick it up from the stop. The lift of the bar should not exceed the height of the robot Athlete's waist.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Robot Athlete must walk towards the lift line while continuously carrying the weight until one foot touches the lift line. During the course, the lifting height of the bar should not change.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>While at least one leg is touching the lift bar, the Robot Athlete must raise the lift bar above its head.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>While keeping the lifting bar above its head, the Robot Athlete must continue walking towards the finish line. A lift is considered successful if the Robot Athlete crosses the finish line with both feet and the weight above its head. The lifting bar should only be supported by the hands of the Robot Athlete.</strong></li>
                <li>After the finish the Robot Athlete must lower the bar to the arena surface by himself.</li>

                <li>During this time each Technician will make repeated attempts on the track based on the order announced by the organizing committee.</li>
                <li>If a Technician is not in line, they lose their attempt and the next Technician takes their turn. The Technician who lost the attempt must wait until all other attempts are completed for their turn to come again.</li>
                <li>The referee records the points for each attempt.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athletes will pass a technical check by the assistant referee before each attempt.</li>
                <li>Only one restart allowed.</li>
                <li>The team may change the designated Technician before each attempt (optional, to involve more team members).</li>
