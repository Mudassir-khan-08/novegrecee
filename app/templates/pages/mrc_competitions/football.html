            <ul>
                <li>At the start of the match, the ball is placed on the cue ball in the center of the court. All Robot Football Players should have some part of them behind the white line of the defending area.</li>
                <li>The match starts with the referee's whistle. All Robot Soccer Players should start moving after the referee's whistle.</li>
                <li>If an alliance scores a goal, then, without stopping time, the ball is placed in the center of the court by the referee and is free for both alliances to claim again. The match is not interrupted but continues until the end of the 7 minutes. If there is a Robot Football Player on the target point at that time, then the ball is placed as close as possible to the target, but not directly in front of the robot located there. The referee will place it to the right or left of the center line at the point of intersection with the cross circle, so that no advantage is given to any Robot Football Player.</li>
                <li>If some of the Robot Football Players get stuck together, then the referee can separate them by moving them as little as possible.</li>
                <li>The referee will blow the whistle for "illegal marking" if a Robot Football Player attempting to get the ball behind an opposing Robot Football Player is found to be pushing and dragging him onto the pitch. After the whistle, the ball is placed in the center of the court and play continues, without stopping time. If a goal is scored due to pushing, it is disallowed.</li>
                <li>The referee will whistle a "red card" if any Robot Football Player is found to be deliberately trying to injure an opponent. In this case the Robot Football Player is kicked out of the match and the alliance continues with 2 Robot Football Players. The referee places the ball back in the center of the field and the match continues with the Robot Football Players in the position they were in when the referee blew the "red card" whistle.</li>
                <li>The Technicians are not allowed to touch their Robot Football Players throughout the match without the permission of the referee.</li>
                <li>If the ball goes out, outside the boundaries of the court behind the goal posts, the referee places the ball back on the cue ball located in the center of the court. If there is a Robot Football Player on the target at that time, then the ball is placed as close as possible to the target, but not directly in front of the robot located there. The referee will place it to the right or left of the center line at the point of intersection with the cross circle, so that no advantage is given to any Robot Football Player.</li>
                <li>It is forbidden for any Robot Football Player of the defending alliance to stand still in front of their goal intentionally or move parallel to the goal line for more than 3 seconds. If it is determined by the referee that the ball was thus prevented from heading towards the goal, the Robot Football Player is rejected from that match and the alliance continues with 2 Robot Football Players.</li>
                <li>The decisions of the referees are final. Objection to these decisions can only be lodged with the Headjudges. Disputing the final decisions of the Headjudges may result in a team or alliance being disqualified.</li>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>ü§ï ROBOT FOOTBALL PLAYER INJURY</h2>
            <p><strong>A Robot Football Player is deemed injured by the referee when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>some part of it has been disassembled,</li>
                <li>remains stationary (lost connection to laptop, controller or tablet),</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Injury Procedures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>An injured Robot Football Player remains out of the field of play until repairs are completed by the team. After permission is given by the referee, he returns to the match. The Robot Football Player returning to the match is placed in the corner of the defense area, right or left at the players' choice. It is forbidden, however, to place the Robot Football Player in a position that gives him an advantage in possession of the ball, e.g. right in front of the ball. The referee can indicate which side the robot will return from if he judges that such an advantage is being created.</li>
                <li>If a Robot Football Player falls over for any reason, with the help of the referee it gets back up and continues the game.</li>
                <li>If all Robot Football Players in an alliance are injured and out of the game, time stops and restarts when even one Robot Soccer Player returns to the field.</li>
                <li>If a Robot Football Player is injured during the match due to the fault of the referee, then the timer stops and the team is given time to repair. Time starts ticking again after the return of the Robot Soccer Player. The players and the ball are placed in the starting position of a match.</li>

            <h2>üéØ BALL CONTROL ‚Äì SHOOTING</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A Robot Football Player should not hold the ball in any way.</li>
                <li>The ball may not penetrate more than 2cm in any part of the Robot Football Player construction.</li>
                <li>A Robot Football Player is not allowed to pick up the ball by placing it on his body in any way.</li>
                <li>A Robot Football Player is not allowed to pick up the ball by placing it under his body.</li>
                <li>If the referee detects that the ball is trapped in any way, he places the ball back in the center of the field and the Robot Football Player away from it. If the blocking is repeated then it is considered intentional and the Robot Football Player is disqualified from that match. The match will continue as normal with 2 Robot Football Players for this alliance.</li>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">üé≤ The Referee places the ball back in the center of the court:</h3>

                <li>When the referee whistles a "red card" on a Robot Football Player.</li>
                <li>When a Robot Football Player traps the ball as above.</li>
                <li>When the ball crosses the entire end line parallel to the goals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">üì§ The Referee releases the ball:</h3>
            <ul>
